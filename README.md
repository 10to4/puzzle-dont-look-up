    Lookup arguments based on logarithmic derivatives are super fast.
    Protocols that use small fields are super fast.
    Let's combine both!

    We've implemented a range check for $[0, 2^6-1]$ using the special-sound
    lookup protocol of [ProtoStar]([url](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/620))
    (see Section 4.3, p. 34) which itself is a variant of [LogUp]([url](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1530)).
    To make this faster, we use a â‰ˆ16-bit prime field and take challenges
    from a larger extension to have roughly 100 bits of security.

    Can you submit a passing proof that $2^{15}$ is in the expected range?
